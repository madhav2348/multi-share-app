# Continuous Scanner App (Only for College students)

A new Flutter project as Major project for college assessment 

## Project Origin :

This project is a based for attendance of students, 

This idea i have at in my second year , when there was no attendance register available in our class 
And whenever lecture ends teachers asked to write down students attendance in a page ,
And it take too much time because of 70 student need to write down one by one 
So, instead of writing and save both paper and time , I just develop this application 

## How to use :
 - First in login page fill up your information
 - If you are C.R.(class representative) or anyone who is taking the  attendance, open the `Scanner/Reciever` by      clicking `Scanner/Reciever Button`
 - If you are giving your attendance, then open `QR Code/Sender` by clicking `QR Code/Sender Button`

 - `Warning` : Only scan the `QR Code` generate by this application only, Other QR will not work
